"""
This program generates a 4-QAM (4-QPSK) and adds noise, a frequency offset, and a phase offset to the signal to
simulate travelling through a channel and is then saved. The program "demod_noisy_4QAM.py" steps through demodulating
the signal

I suggest stepping through this line by line in a console
